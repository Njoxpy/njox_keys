# **üìö Database Design Documentation**

## **Overview**

This section provides an overview of the database design for the system, outlining the entities and their relationships within the system, along with the schema definitions.

### **üìå Entities**

The system comprises the following core entities:

| **Entity** | **Description** |
|:-----------|----------------|
| **Venue** | Stores venue information, such as name, block, capacity, equipment,description, images, status, and abbreviation. |
| **Users** | Represents the registered users, with attributes like first name, last name, email, registration number, course, phone number, and role (employee/admin). |
| **Order** | Contains the details of the venue bookings, including the venue info (name, block, capacity, equipment, images, status), along with the user ID who made the booking. |
| **Logs** | Logs user actions in the system, captured using a logging package (e.g., Winston) rather than a model. |

### **üìå Define Schema Design**

This section outlines the schema design for each entity in the database:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Venue Schema**

The **Venue** entity will store details about each venue in the system.

```json
{
  "abbreviation": "kifupisho",
  "block": "6A",
  "capacity": 34,
  "description": "just description about the venue",
  "equipment": [
    "projector",
    "microphone"
  ],
  "images": [],
  "name": "new lecture hall3",
  "status": "available",
  "__v": 0
}
```

- equipment is the array for the list of equipments available, images.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Users Schema**

The **Users** entity captures information about the users of the system, including their personal details and role.

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "registrationNumber": "12345",
  "course": "Computer Science",
  "phoneNumber": "123-456-7890",
  "role": "employee",  // admin or employee
  "createdAt": ISODate("2025-02-20T12:00:00Z"),
  "updatedAt": ISODate("2025-02-20T12:00:00Z")
}
```

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Order Schema**

The **Order** schema links a user to a venue booking, with details about the venue and booking status.

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "venueId": ObjectId("..."),  // Reference to the Venue document
  "userId": ObjectId("..."),  // Reference to the User document
  "status": "booked",  // booked, cancelled, pending
  "bookingDate": ISODate("2025-02-20T14:00:00Z"),
  "createdAt": ISODate("2025-02-20T12:00:00Z"),
  "updatedAt": ISODate("2025-02-20T12:00:00Z")
}
```

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Logs Schema**

For logging user activities, you‚Äôll be using the **Winston** package for logging. Instead of a database schema, logs will be handled by Winston and stored in files or a centralized logging service.

### **Note:**  

For logging purposes, we will not use a database model but will rely on **Winston** for capturing logs. The logs will be stored in files or integrated with services like **AWS CloudWatch**, **Loggly**, or **Elasticsearch** for easier searching and monitoring.

---

### **üìå Relationships Between Entities**

- **Users** can have many **Orders** (One-to-Many relationship).
- **Orders** reference a **Venue** (Many-to-One relationship).
- **Venue** can be linked to multiple **Orders**, but each order is for one venue.
  
---

### **üìå Schema Considerations & Constraints**

- **Data Validation:**  
  - Ensure that fields like `email`, `phone number`, and `registration number` are **unique**.
  - Validate `status` fields to restrict them to specific values (e.g., `booked`, `available`).

- **Soft Deletes:**  
  - Instead of hard-deleting, consider adding an `isDeleted` field to mark entities for deletion (e.g., in the **User** schema).

- **Indexes:**  
  - Create indexes for frequently queried fields like `email`, `venueId`, and `userId` to speed up lookups.

---

### **üìå Logging with Winston**

Logs are a crucial part of monitoring system usage and debugging issues. Here's an example configuration for **Winston** logging:

```js
const winston = require('winston');

// Create a logger instance
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/combined.log' }),
    new winston.transports.Console({ format: winston.format.simple() })
  ]
});

// Example of logging an error
logger.error('This is an error log');

// Example of logging an info message
logger.info('User John Doe has successfully booked a venue.');
```

### **üìå Indexing Strategy for Performance**

| **Collection** | **Field**           | **Type**          | **Purpose**                  |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **users**      | `email`             | Unique Index      | To prevent duplicate emails and enable fast lookup |
| **orders**     | `userId`            | Index             | To quickly find all orders by a specific user |
| **venue**      | `status`            | Index             | To quickly find available venues |
| **logs**       | `timestamp`         | Index             | To efficiently query logs by time |

---

### **üìå Best Practices**

- **Normalization vs Denormalization:**  
  For MongoDB, we use a **denormalized** approach to embed related documents when it makes sense (e.g., embedding venue info in orders).
  
- **Data Duplication:**  
  Although some data duplication might occur, it‚Äôs important for performance reasons in MongoDB to reduce the need for complex joins.

- **Backup & Recovery:**  
  Implement a strategy for database backups (daily or weekly) and ensure that your data is resilient to failures.

### **üìå Future Considerations**

As the system evolves, here are a few potential improvements:

- **Adding a messaging queue** for handling asynchronous operations like email notifications and processing payments.
- **Implementing user authentication** (JWT tokens) to securely manage users and their roles.
- **Considering horizontal scaling** and sharding in MongoDB for performance as the user base grows.
