Got it! So, you're adding **venues** to the key management system, which means users (students/teachers) will be requesting **specific venues** for keys. This means you'll need to integrate **venue management** into your MVP. Let’s adjust the MVP to include this critical component.

### **MVP Features with Venue Integration:**

---

### **1. Venue Management**

- **Admin Side**:
  - **Add/Edit/Remove Venues**: Admins can add new venues to the system (e.g., classrooms, meeting rooms, etc.).
  - **View Venue Availability**: Admins can see the status of all venues (whether they’re **in use**, **available**, or **booked**).
  
- **User Side (Watchers)**:
  - **Select Venue**: When requesting a key, **users must select a venue** from a list of available venues.
  - **Check Venue Availability**: Users can see if a venue is **available** at the selected time.

### **2. Key Request with Venue**

- When requesting a key, **students/teachers** must specify:
  - **Venue name/ID**
  - **Date and Time**: Ensuring the venue is available at the requested time.
  
- **Request Validation**:
  - The system should **validate** if the venue is already **booked** at the requested time.

### **3. Venue Request Flow**

1. **Watchers** scan the QR code to get user information.
2. **User selects a venue** from a list of available venues.
3. **Check Venue Availability**:
   - If the venue is **available**, allow the user to submit the key request.
   - If the venue is **not available**, notify the user and suggest alternative times.
4. **Admin Approval**:
   - Admin approves the request for the venue and key.
   - Admin can see **which venues are requested** and **who has them** at any given time.

### **Database Changes**

1. **Venues Table**:
   - Store venue data (ID, name, capacity, location, status).
   - Each venue can have a status (e.g., available, booked, under maintenance).

2. **Key Request Table**:
   - Store which **user** requested the key for a **venue** at a **specific time**.
   - Track **venue availability** in relation to key requests.

### **Admin Dashboard Updates**

  - Admin can view, add, and edit **venue details**.
  - Admin can view a **calendar-like view** showing venue availability.

### **Key Focus Areas for Venue Integration:**

1. **User Experience (UX)**: Keep the venue selection **simple** and easy to use. Don't overwhelm users with too many choices. If possible, group venues by type or location.
2. **Validation**: Ensure the system properly **checks venue availability** before finalizing a key request.
3. **Admin Visibility**: The admin should be able to see which venues are **booked** at any time, preventing overbooking.

### **Challenge for You**

- Integrate **venue availability** into the key request flow as seamlessly as possible.
- Make sure your **venue management interface** is intuitive for admins and doesn’t overcomplicate the process.

By focusing on **venue management** early on, you'll have a key part of your app working smoothly and set the foundation for scaling the system later on. Let me know if you need any more details or help with this!
