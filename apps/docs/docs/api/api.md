## Introduction

The Key Management System (KMS) API is designed to help organizations manage key data securely and efficiently. The API provides endpoints for managing users, venues, orders, and logs. It supports only 2 rules `(admin and employee)` with different levels of access and allows for seamless integration into existing applications.

Use this API to streamline key management processes, monitor system activity, and ensure data integrity across all services.

## Setup & Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before using the API, ensure you have the following:

1. **API Access Token**: Obtain a token via the authentication process.
2. **Dependencies**: If needed, install any required dependencies.

### Authentication

To authenticate API requests, pass your bearer token in the request headers. Example:

```http
Authorization: Bearer [Your_Token]
X-RateLimit-Limit: <limit> /<period> (e.g., 10/min)
```

## API Endpoints

## Authentication & Rate Limiting

This section details how authentication is handled and any applicable rate limits for API access.

### Authentication

To authenticate with the API, include the following header in your requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer [Your_Token]
```

### Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limiting to prevent abuse. Example rate limit header:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100/min
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 99/min
```

## Error Codes and Messages

The following error codes may be returned by the API:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input or missing parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid authentication token.
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A server-side error occurred.

## Unit Test Samples

Hereâ€™s an example of a Python unit test for the `/users` endpoint using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

def test_get_users():
    response = requests.get(
        'https://api.example.com/api/v1/users',
        headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert len(response.json()) > 0
```

example of another test written using express.js

```js
import {express} from "express"

describe.("action", (_id) => {
  it('should return new user into the syetm')
})
```
