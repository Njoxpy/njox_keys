# 🐞 Bug Fix: Uploaded Images Not Displaying in Browser

## 🧩 Issue Summary

After uploading images successfully to the backend (`uploads/` folder), the images would not display in the frontend (React) or open directly via browser.

---

## ❌ Symptoms

- React shows **broken image icons**.
- Direct browser link like `http://localhost:5000/uploads/test.jpg` gives **blank or 404**.
- Console shows:
```

NS_ERROR_DOM_CORP_FAILED
Blocked due to Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy header (or lack thereof)

````

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

1. **Static files (`uploads/`) were not correctly exposed** in Express.
2. **Browser blocked image loading** due to **missing CORS/CORP headers**, since the frontend and backend are on different ports.

---

## ✅ Solution

In your `server.js`, fix the static route to serve the `uploads/` folder **correctly** and **securely**:

```js
const path = require("path");

app.use(
"/uploads",
express.static(path.join(__dirname, "uploads"), {
  setHeaders: (res, path, stat) => {
    res.set("Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy", "cross-origin");
  },
})
);
````

### 🔑 Key Notes:

- `path.join(__dirname, "uploads")` ensures absolute correct path.
- The header `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` tells the browser: "It's safe to load this image from another port."

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. Create a file `test.txt` inside `uploads/`
2. Visit: [http://localhost:5000/uploads/test.txt](http://localhost:5000/uploads/test.txt)

If the file opens — �� static serving works!

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip

In your React component, load the image like this:

```jsx
{
  venue.images && venue.images.length > 0 && (
    <img
      src={`${baseURL}/uploads/${venue.images[0]}`}
      alt={venue.name}
      className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
  );
}
```

Make sure `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:5000` (or your prod API URL).

---

## 🚀 One-Line Summary

> Serve static files properly using `express.static()` and CORS-friendly headers or the browser will silently block your images.
