Great! Since you’ve installed Redis using Docker, let’s make sure it’s running smoothly and cover some basics for using it on Windows. Assuming you followed the steps like pulling the Redis image and starting a container, here’s how to proceed:
Verify It’s Running

    Check the Container:
        Open a terminal (e.g., Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal) and run:

        docker ps

        Look for a container named redis-server (or whatever name you gave it with --name). If it’s not listed, start it with:

        docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-server redis

        -d runs it in the background, -p 6379:6379 maps the Redis port to your localhost.
    Test the Connection:
        If you have a Redis client installed on Windows (e.g., redis-cli via WSL or a GUI like RedisInsight), connect to localhost:6379 and run:

        PING

        Expect PONG back.
        Alternatively, use Docker to access the CLI directly:

        docker exec -it redis-server redis-cli

        Then type PING—same result.

Basic Redis Commands
Now that it’s running, here are some quick commands to get you started (run these in redis-cli):

    Set a Key-Value Pair:

    SET mykey "Hello Redis"

    Get the Value:

    GET mykey

    (Returns "Hello Redis")
    Check if a Key Exists:

    EXISTS mykey

    (Returns 1 if it exists, 0 if not)

Managing the Container

    Stop Redis:

    docker stop redis-server

    Restart Redis:

    docker start redis-server

    Remove the Container (if you want a fresh start):

    docker rm -f redis-server

    Then recreate it with the docker run command.

Persistence (Optional)
By default, Redis in Docker doesn’t save data between container restarts. To enable persistence:

    Create a directory on your Windows machine, e.g., C:\RedisData.
    Run the container with a volume:

    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-server -v C:\RedisData:/data redis

        /data is where Redis stores its dump file inside the container.
    Edit the Redis config (optional for advanced use):
        You’d need to mount a custom redis.conf file, but for basic use, the default settings work fine.

Accessing from Your Application

    Redis is now available at localhost:6379. If your app (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.) is on Windows, use a Redis client library (like redis-py for Python or ioredis for Node.js) and point it to that address.
    Example in Python:
    python

    import redis
    r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
    r.set('key', 'value')
    print(r.get('key'))  # Outputs: b'value'

Troubleshooting

    Port Conflict: If 6379 is already in use, check with netstat -a -n -o and either free it or use a different port (e.g., -p 6380:6379).
    Docker Not Running: Ensure Docker Desktop is started (check the system tray).

You’re all set! What do you plan to use Redis for? If you need help with a specific use case or configuration, just let me know!
